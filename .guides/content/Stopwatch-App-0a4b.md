Chapter 4 looks at how activities work under the hood, common ways in which your apps can break, and how you can fix them using the activity lifecycle methods. 

The Stopwatch app consists of a single activity and a single layout. The layout includes a text view showing you how much time has passed, a Start button that starts the stopwatch, a Stop button that stops it, and a Reset button that resets the timer value to zero.
